 This screen is used to set up the JCL for a batch COBOL compile.  Fill
 in the screen fields as follows:

 Member: ________
     The name of the program to be compiled.  You may enter either the
     first 6 characters of the name (e.g. BATC01), or all 8 characters
     including the version number.  The{ACC}processor will determine the
     correct version number.  If more than one program resides on the
     source library with the same base name, a list of such programs
     will be presented to the user from which to select.  For example,
     if both BATC0101 and BATC0102 are on the library,{ACC}allows the
     user to pick the one she wishes to compile.

 Replace?: _ (y/n)
     An answer of Yes tells{ACC}to replace the source module on Library
     with a like named Roscoe member.  For example, if Roscoe member
     BATC01 contains modifications you just made to program BATC01 and
     you now wish to replace the version on Library before compiling
     it, enter a "Y" in this field. {ACC}then inserts the contents of
     Roscoe member BATC01 into the JCL to replace the current contents
     of Library member BATC01vv.  If it is unclear which Roscoe member
     to use, the user is presented with a selection list.  For example,
     if you are compiling program BATC0102 and there are Roscoe members
     BATC01 and BATC0102, the user will be given the choice of which
     Roscoe member to use for replacement.

 from Roscoe Member: ________
     The name of the Roscoe member to be used to replace the source
     program on Library.  This appears only when Replace? is "Y".

 URT: ________
     The name of the URT to use when compiling a batch program which
     uses DataCom (i.e., has calls to DBNTRY).  The{ACC}RPF uses the
     program name supplied in Member to search the URT library to see
     if a URT exists for this program.  If it does, then the URT name
     is entered and the program is assumed to be a DataCom program.
     If no URT is found, the program is assumed to contain no DBNTRY
     calls.  If the assumption is incorrect, then you may change the
     "Y" or "N" in DataCom to its opposite value.

 DataCom?: _ (y/n)
     Use this field to indicate whether or not the program contains
     calls to DBNTRY.


 All other options shown on this screen are taken from the values set
 up on the default options screen.  Any of these may be changed on this
 screen.  However, any such changes are only for this run; the defaults
 are not changed.


 PF2-Set Defaults:  make permanent changes to the default options.

 PF5-Skip:  skip the compile of the currently named program.  This is
     useful primarily when processing a list of programs and you wish
     to bypass a program while continuing processing the remainer of
     the list.

 PF8-Edit JCL:  Produce the JCL and put it in the Roscoe AWS without
     submitting it.

 PF9-Submit:  Produce the JCL and submit it.
