     The library where your source code will reside.  Blank out the
     field to obtain the default.

 Look for SQL?: N (Y/N)
     This parameter directs{ACC}to look for SQL code in your programs
     and to insert the SQL translator in your JCL when necessary.
     NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

 Map Copy Lib: HLQ.XXX.DVL.ONLMAP_________________
     The library into which to put the map copybook which results from
     the assembly of a BMS map.  Blank to obtain default.

 URT Source Lib: HLQ.XXX.DVL.URTMAST________________

     Blank to obtain default.

 w/ Intertest?: Y (Y/N)
     This parameter tells{ACC}whether or not to include the JCL needed

     load module, but simply builds the tables necessary to debug your
     online program.

 Batch LoadLib: HLQ.XXX.DVL.BATLOAD________________
     The library into which to place the load modules for your batch
     programs.  Blank to obtain default.

 w/ Intertest?: N (Y/N)
     Tells{ACC}whether to include JCL to provide for the batch version
     of Intertest.  NOT YET AVAILABLE.

 URT LoadLib: HLQ.XXX.DVL.BATLOAD________________
     The library in which to find the load modules of the user's URTs.
     Blank to obtain default.
