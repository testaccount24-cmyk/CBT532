Sam,

RPF stands for Roscoe Programming Facility.  An Rpf is
analogous to a Rexx exec and a Tso/Ispf edit macro.
From the manual:

Roscoe programming Facility is a high-level, interactive
structured programming language that supports full
arithmetic capability, built-in functions and a variety
of different types of variables.  It supports all
CA-Roscoe commands and facilities. etc.

Most of what I sent to you is for compiling and working
with Cobol/CICS/DatacomDB programs and for searching
Roscoe libraries, Librarian libraries and PDS libraries.

I would suggest something like: "File # 532 Roscoe
Programming Facility programs".

If this is not what you need just let me know.  Thanks.
