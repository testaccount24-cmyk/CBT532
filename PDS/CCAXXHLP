 This screen is used to set up the JCL for an assembly of a BMS macro
 for a CICS map.  Fill in the screen fields as follows:

 Member: ________
     The name of the map to be assembled.  You may enter either the
     first 6 characters of the name (e.g. CMA123), or all 8 characters
     including the version number. The{ACC}processor will determine the
     correct version number.  If more than one map resides on the
     source library with the same base name, a list of such maps will
     be presented to the user from which to select.  For example, if
     both CMA12301 and CMA12302 are on the library,{ACC}allows the user
     to pick the one she wishes to assemble.

 Replace?: _ (y/n)
     An answer of Yes tells{ACC}to replace the source module on Library
     with a like named Roscoe member.  For example, if Roscoe member
     CMA123 contains modifications you just made to map CMA123 and you
     now wish to replace the version on Library before assembling it,
     enter a "Y" in this field. {ACC}then inserts the contents of Roscoe
     member CMA123 into the JCL to replace the current contents of
     Library member CMA123vv.  If it is unclear which Roscoe member to
     use, the user is presented with a selection list.  For example, if
     you are assembling map CMA12302 and there are Roscoe members
     CMA123 and CMA12302, the user will be given the choice of which
     Roscoe member to use for replacement.

 from Roscoe Member: ________
     The name of the Roscoe member to be used to replace the source
     map program on Library when Replace? is "Y".


 All other options shown on this screen are taken from the values set
 up on the default options screen.  Any of these may be changed on this
 screen.  However, any such changes are only for this run; the defaults
 are not changed.


 PF2-Set Defaults:  make permanent changes to the default options.

 PF5-Skip:  skip the assembly of the currently named map.  This is
     useful primarily when processing a list of maps and you wish to
     bypass a map but continue processing the remainer of the list.

 PF8-Edit JCL:  Produce the JCL and put it in the Roscoe AWS without
     submitting it.

 PF9-Submit:  Produce the JCL and submit it.
