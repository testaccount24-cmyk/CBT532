 This is the entry point screen for the{ACC}(Compiles) RPF. ACC enables
 a user to generate the JCL necessary to compile most programs commonly
 found at xxxxxxx, namely CICS assembler maps, CICS COBOL programs, and
 batch COBOL programs with and without DataCom.

 If you read this help screen carefully, you should have little trouble
 with the remaining screens and concepts.

 After entering ACC, fill in the fields found on this screen as follows:

 OPTION:  Enter{"A"}to{assemble}a CICS map
               {"B"}to compile a{batch}COBOL program
               {"C"}to compile a{CICS}COBOL program.
          Enter{"\"}to enable two additional options
               {"P"}to assemble a{CICS}ASSEMBLER
               {"T"}to assemble a{CICS}TABLE.

 MEMBER:  Enter the{name of the member to be compiled,}with or without
          the version number.  The version number will be automatically
          filled in when only one version exists on the source library.
          When more than one version exists, the user will be presented
          with a selection list.
          Entry of an{"L"}here invokes list processing in which ACC will
          compile/assemble all programs in a list.

 REPLACE: Entry of a{"Y"}here indicates to ACC that the user wishes to
         {replace the selected Library member}with the content of one
          of his Roscoe members.

 SUBMIT:  Entry of a{"Y"}here indicates to ACC that the JCL is to be
         {submitted immediately,}without showing any more screens, if
          there are no problems with the information entered.

{This screen can be bypassed entirely}by making an entry on the Roscoe
 command line of the following form:
{ ACC option member <REP> <SUB>}   (<...> indicates an optional entry)
       where option is the entry for OPTION above (A, B, or C)
             member is the entry for MEMBER above
             REP sets the REPLACE option to "Y"       (REP and SUB are
             SUB sets the SUBMIT option to "Y"         interchangeable)

 Example: ACC C CPP185 REP SUB
     will submit CPP185vv for CICS COBOL compile, replacing the module
     on Librarian from a Roscoe member, submitting the job without
     presenting a screen if there are no problems.
